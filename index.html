        <h2>Cracking the Code of National Well-Being: Factors Behind Happiness</h2>
        <p>
          In our pursuit of understanding the true sources of a nation's happiness, we delve into six critical factors that
          influence a country's well-being. Each of these factors isn't just a number; it's an essential piece of the
          puzzle, a
          strand intricately intertwined with the hopes and aspirations of a nation's people. These factors play a crucial
          role
          in shaping the overall happiness of the country. As we explore these six foundational elements, we uncover their
          profound
          and interconnected impact on the collective joy experienced by a nation. These aren't isolated data points but
          rather
          the building blocks of societal prosperity and fulfillment.

            <p class="factors">Economic prosperity plays a pivotal role in the happiness of a nation. GDP reflects a
              country's
              financial strength and the potential for a higher quality of life. A robust GDP can provide resources for
              education,
              healthcare, and infrastructure, enhancing citizens' well-being.

            <p class="factors">Strong social bonds and a sense of belonging contribute to a nation's happiness. Social
              support
              systems are the foundation of well-being. Communities that prioritize social support tend to have citizens who
              feel
              safer, more connected, and emotionally fulfilled.

              build
              trust and stability. A low level of corruption creates an environment where citizens can rely on fair
              institutions
              and have confidence in their nation's future.

              nation's citizens. Access to quality healthcare, sanitation, and healthy lifestyles contribute to increased life

              participate in society without fear fosters a sense of fulfillment and contentment.

              the willingness to support one another, making the world a happier place. Acts of kindness and generosity create a
              ripple effect, positively impacting the happiness of individuals and the nation as a whole.</p>

    <h2>The Key Drivers of Happiness: GDP and Social Support</h2>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
      <p>
        Among the six factors that influence a country's happiness, GDP and Social Support emerge as two primary factors with a substantial impact on happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        A higher <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> often correlates with greater material 
        well-being and the ability to fulfill basic needs and desires, contributing significantly to overall happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social support</b> plays a crucial role in mental well-being and happiness as it provides emotional safety nets and 
        companionship in times of need.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find more detailed information and in-depth research on the factors affecting a country's happiness, including 
        GDP and social support, by exploring the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report">World Happiness Report </a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The two scatter plots presented below illustrate the correlations between GDP and the happiness index, as well as 
        social support and happiness across various countries. The size of each data point corresponds to the population of 
        the respective country. To focus on specific regions, you can <b><i>either click on a region in the legend or utilize the 
        region filter to display only the countries within the selected region.</i></b>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div id="vis2" class="vis-container"></div>

    <h2>Freedom and Generosity Over The Years</h2>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
      <p>
        The two visualizations presented below illustrate the average levels of freedom and generosity across various regions 
        from 2015 to 2021. <b><i>Highlight different regions to gain more insight by clicking on the legend.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A notable upswing in freedom is evident, indicating a positive trajectory in terms of civil and political liberties. 
        Conversely, generosity displays a declining trend, signifying a decrease in charitable giving and community spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increase in freedom is often associated with a heightened sense of empowerment and self-determination among citizens, 
        contributing positively to overall happiness. In contrast, the declining generosity trend may indicate weakening social bonds and reduced mutual support, potentially 
        impacting happiness levels negatively.

    <h2>Corruption and Life Expectancy Trends Across Different Regions</h2>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
      <p>
        The two visualizations provided below offer a comparative analysis of corruption levels in the years 2015 and 2021, 
        as well as a depiction of life expectancy trends over time. <b><i>In the second visualization, you can utilize the slider 
          to filter data by year.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Examining the ranged dot plot illustrating corruption ranges, it becomes evident that corruption has surged between 
        2015 and 2021 across most regions, with the noteworthy exception of Australia and New Zealand, where it has actually 
        decreased. This rise in corruption has, in turn, negatively impacted the happiness levels of countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning to the life expectancy box plot, it reveals a mixed picture. Some regions have witnessed an increase in 
        life expectancy, while others have experienced a decline. These fluctuations can be attributed to various factors, 
        such as healthcare access and socio-economic conditions, and they have significant implications for the happiness 
        levels of countries.

    <h2>Top 10 Happiest Countries and Least Happiest Countries</h2>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
      <p>
        Presented below are two interactive bar charts displaying the rankings of the top 10 happiest and least happiest 
        countries. The <strong style="color:red;">red line indicates the World Average Happiness Index.</strong> <b><i>You can 
          utilize the slider below to customize the view by selecting different years.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon examining the charts, a clear pattern emerges: the happiest countries predominantly hail from Western Europe, while 
        the least happiest ones are primarily situated in Sub-Saharan Africa. This divergence in happiness levels can be 
        attributed to multifaceted socio-economic factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Western European countries often enjoy stable economies, robust social support systems, and advanced healthcare and 
        education, contributing to higher happiness levels among their populations. In contrast, many Sub-Saharan African 
        countries contend with economic challenges, political instability, and limited access to essential services, which can 
        have a detrimental impact on overall well-being and happiness.
