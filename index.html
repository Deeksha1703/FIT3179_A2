        <h2>Cracking the Code of National Well-Being: Factors Behind Happiness</h2>
        <p>
          In our pursuit of understanding the true sources of a nation's happiness, we delve into six critical factors that
          influence a country's well-being. Each of these factors isn't just a number; it's an essential piece of the
          puzzle, a
          strand intricately intertwined with the hopes and aspirations of a nation's people. These factors play a crucial
          role
          in shaping the overall happiness of the country. As we explore these six foundational elements, we uncover their
          profound
          and interconnected impact on the collective joy experienced by a nation. These aren't isolated data points but
          rather
          the building blocks of societal prosperity and fulfillment.

            <p class="factors">Economic prosperity plays a pivotal role in the happiness of a nation. GDP reflects a
              country's
              financial strength and the potential for a higher quality of life. A robust GDP can provide resources for
              education,
              healthcare, and infrastructure, enhancing citizens' well-being.

              systems are the foundation of well-being. Communities that prioritize social support tend to have citizens who
              feel
              safer, more connected, and emotionally fulfilled.

              build
              trust and stability. A low level of corruption creates an environment where citizens can rely on fair
              institutions
              and have confidence in their nation's future.

    <h2>The Key Drivers of Happiness: GDP and Social Support</h2>

    <div class="pure-u-1">
      <p>
        Among the six factors that influence a country's happiness – GDP, Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom, Corruption, 
        and Generosity – GDP and Social Support emerge as two primary factors with a substantial impact on happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> represents a nation's economic wealth and prosperity. It reflects its citizens' access to 
        resources, employment opportunities, and overall standard of living. A higher GDP often correlates with greater material 
        well-being and the ability to fulfill basic needs and desires, contributing significantly to overall happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social support</b>, on the other hand, encompasses strong relationships, community bonds, and a sense of belonging. 
        This factor plays a crucial role in mental well-being and happiness as it provides emotional safety nets and 
        companionship in times of need.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conclusion that GDP and social support are among the most significant factors affecting happiness is drawn from 
        extensive research in positive psychology and annual reports like the World Happiness Report. These sources consistently 
        underscore the importance of these elements in determining a nation's happiness and well-being. While the other factors 
        also contribute, GDP and social support stand out as essential pillars in promoting happiness within a society.
      </p>
