      <h2>Cracking the Code of National Well-Being: Factors Behind Happiness</h2>
      <p>
        In our pursuit of understanding the true sources of a nation's happiness, we delve into six critical factors that 
        influence a country's well-being. Each of these factors isn't just a number; it's an essential piece of the puzzle, a 
        strand intricately intertwined with the hopes and aspirations of a nation's people. These factors play a crucial role 
        in shaping the overall happiness of the country.As we explore these six foundational elements, we uncover their profound
        and interconnected impact on the collective joy experienced by a nation. These aren't isolated data points but rather 
        the building blocks of societal prosperity and fulfillment.
